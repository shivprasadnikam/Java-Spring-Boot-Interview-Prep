## Core Concepts

### What are Microservices?
- Independently deployable services
- Organized around business capabilities
- Own their own data storage
- Communicate via lightweight protocols (HTTP/REST, gRPC, events)
- Can be developed and deployed independently

### Key Characteristics
- **Componentization via Services**
- **Business Capability Oriented**
- **Decentralized Governance**
- **Infrastructure Automation**
- **Design for Failure**
- **Evolutionary Design**

## Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
- Each service should have exactly one responsibility
- Focused on a single business capability
- Easier to understand, develop, and maintain

### 2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Bounded Contexts
- Ubiquitous Language
- Aggregates and Domain Events
- Anti-Corruption Layer

### 3. API-First Design
- Contract-first approach
- Versioning strategies
- Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Service Discovery
- Client-side vs Server-side discovery
- Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka
- Consul, etcd, Zookeeper

### 2. API Gateway
- Routing and composition
- Authentication/Authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Spring Cloud Gateway implementation

### 3. Circuit Breaker
- Fault tolerance patterns
- Resilience4j implementation
- Fallback mechanisms

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
- Event sourcing
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Kafka, RabbitMQ integration

## Spring Cloud Ecosystem

### Essential Components
- **Spring Cloud Config** - Centralized configuration
- **Spring Cloud Bus** - Event bus for services
- **Spring Cloud Stream** - Event-driven microservices
- **Spring Cloud Sleuth** - Distributed tracing
- **Spring Cloud Security** - OAuth2, JWT support

### Implementation Example: Service Registration
```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class ServiceRegistryApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ServiceRegistryApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

## Data Management

### Database per Service
- Challenges and solutions
- Eventual consistency
- Saga pattern implementation
- CQRS with Axon Framework

### Transaction Management
- Two-phase commit vs SAGA
- Event sourcing
- Outbox pattern

## Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Testing
- Testing individual components
- Mocking dependencies
- Test containers

### 2. Integration Testing
- Service-to-service communication
- Contract testing with Pact
- Component testing

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- Test environments
- Performance testing
- Chaos engineering

## Monitoring & Observability

### Essential Metrics
- Application metrics (Micrometer)
- Business metrics
- Distributed tracing (Zipkin, Jaeger)

### Logging Strategies
- Centralized logging (ELK Stack)
- Correlation IDs
- Structured logging

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect
- JWT tokens
- API Gateway security

### Secure Communication
- mTLS
- Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)
- Network policies

## Deployment Strategies

### Containerization
- Docker best practices
- Multi-stage builds
- Image scanning

### Orchestration
- Kubernetes deployment
- Helm charts
- GitOps with ArgoCD

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Blue/Green deployments
- Canary releases
- Feature flags

## Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

### Anti-patterns to Avoid
- Distributed monolith
- Overly chatty services
- Inconsistent data models
- Ignoring cross-cutting concerns

### Best Practices
- API versioning from day one
- Comprehensive documentation
- Automated testing at all levels
- Monitoring and alerting
- Chaos engineering practices

## Interview Questions

### Design Questions
1. How would you design a scalable e-commerce platform using microservices?
2. Explain your approach to handling distributed transactions across services.
3. How would you implement a search feature that spans multiple services?

### Technical Deep Dives
1. Explain how you would handle service discovery in a multi-cloud environment.
2. Describe your approach to versioning microservices APIs.
3. How would you implement cross-cutting concerns like logging and monitoring?
